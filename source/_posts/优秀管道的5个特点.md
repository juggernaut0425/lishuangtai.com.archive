# 优秀交付管道的5个特点

持续交付（Continuous Delivery）不仅提升了开发团队的自信，并且将交付新功能变为商业决策，使产品团队也获益匪浅。

<!--Continuous Delivery provides great benefits not only for the team developing the software, by increasing their confidence, but also for the product team, since the delivery of new features becomes a pure business decision.-->

交付管道（delivery pipeline）是持续交付的核心。它显示了团队如何将变更交付到生产，并且为项目质量把控提供了一站式的服务。

<!--At the center of it all is the delivery pipeline. It shows how the team delivers changes to production and also provides a one stop shop for project quality.
-->

优秀管道有一些关键的特点需要尽量达成；本文会列举我研究过的5个。当然这并不是一个完整的列表，每个项目都应该考虑各自的特点。但是我工作过的项目，少了某个特征，会给团队造成麻烦。

<!--Good pipelines have some key traits that every pipeline should aim to achieve; in this article I'll talk about five that I've observed. It's not an extensive list and of course, every project has its own context that must be respected, but in projects I've worked on, when one of these traits was absent, it has caused the team trouble.-->


1. 能够提高质量产品

	大部分管道都会包括一系列的验证，从 代码静态分析 到 完整的UI测试。并没有明确准则定义哪些该包含在管道中，我认为**如果能够提供有效的质量反馈，就应该被包含在管道中**。

	然而，有一些验证经常被团队忽略，像 cross-functional tests。这些测试通常跟性能有关，但也可以测试应用能承受的负载以及暴露安全缺陷。

	<!--1. Builds Quality into the Product
	Most pipelines have verifications that range from code linting to full UI based tests. There is no rule to define what goes into a pipeline, but I believe that if it provides useful feedback about quality, it should be in the pipeline.
	
	However, there are some verifications that teams don’t always remember, like the cross-functional tests. These tests are usually about performance, but can test the load the application can take or even look for security breaches.-->

	为了使团队获取每个修改的这方面反馈，**这些测试（cross-functional tests）应该被包含在管道中，并且尽可能自动执行。**即使公司对所有产品都会进行负载测试以保证产品的每个部分都能应对流量，团队也应该将小型的负载测试作为管道的一环。

	<!--To ensure the team gets feedback on every change, these tests should be automated as much as possible and should also be a  part of the pipeline. Even if the company has a big event to load test all products and ensure the various parts of the product can handle the traffic, a team should still run small load tests as part of the pipeline.-->

	Cross-functional tests通常在管道中需要做一些特殊处理。如果其中一项测试失败，有时候并不需要停止整个过程。假设产品的性能低于了某个阈值，并不意味它不能工作了。
	
	<!--Cross-functional tests usually receive a special treatment in the pipeline. If one of them fails, they don't always need to stop the whole suite. Let's say the performance of the application has dropped below a specified threshold. Does it mean it won't work? Not necessarily.-->

	***cross-functional checks应该指导团队下一步的行动而不是使构建失败。这表示测试的功能可以运行；所以团队必须考虑项目，决定什么样子的交叉功能测试应该替换并且怎么生效。***
	
	<!--Instead of failing the build, cross-functional checks should provide actions for the team. This implies that what is measured is also actionable; so the team must consider the context of the project in order to decide what cross-functional tests will be in place and how they'll work.-->
	
	回到性能降低的例子，团能能够追踪到上次修改后，应用的哪一部分变慢。能够调查出可能的因素，接下来我们进入第二个因素。
	
	<!--Going back to the performance drop example, the team should, ideally, be able to track down exactly which part of the app got slower since the last check-in and to investigate possible causes, which leads us to the second trait.-->

2. 可以提供快速而有效的反馈

	<!--2. Provide Quick and Effective Feedback-->

	将质量检测加入到管道中是非常棒的，同时团队也需要接收每次变更的反馈，并且这些反馈需要迅速。
	
	<!--Having quality checks built into the pipeline is great, but the team also needs to receive feedback upon every check in, and it should be fast!-->
	
	尽快反馈，我们应该遵循 [Fail-Fast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-fast) 原则。所以，相对快速的任务，例如代码静态分析（code lint）或者单元测试（unit tests），应该在前边运行；手动测试和性能检查，尽可能在我们确定代码有效后进行。
	
	<!--When thinking about providing fast feedback, we must follow the idea of failing as soon as possible. Faster tasks, like code lint or unit tests, should be among the first to run, whereas manual test or performance checks should only happen after we are sure that the code is sound.-->
	
	并行运行任务，对减少获取反馈的时间也有很大帮助。
	
	假设，你的管道：代码静态分析（需要2分钟），单元测试（需要另外2分钟），集成测试（需要5分钟）。串行管道情况下，设想下最糟糕的场景，一次提交使造成三个任务都失败，需要花费24分钟，才能得到一次成功的构建。
	
	<!--Running tasks in parallel is also a great idea to reduce the feedback cycle. For example, let's say that as part of your pipeline you have code lint (which takes 2 minutes), unit tests (another 2 minutes) and integration tests (which take a little longer, 5 minutes). Considering the worst case scenario, where a commit breaks all three jobs, it would take 24 minutes just to get a green build in the sequential pipeline.
-->

	同样的情况，如果并行的执行任务，你的团队紧紧需要花费5分钟获取反馈，另外5分钟得到一次成功的构建。
	
	<!--Now, if we setup our tasks to run in parallel, and if a code breaks each job, it would only take five minutes for your team to get feedback and another five to get a green build.-->
	![](/img/Delivery_Pipeline03_63cf3b1b24be11e38aa44b04d5c4bdc3.png)
	
	像探索性和可用性测试等手工步骤，反馈周期很长。因为这依赖人工使用系统，通常作为最后一个执行步骤。但是仍然应该是反馈中的一环。
	
	<!--Manual steps, like exploratory and usability testing, have a long feedback cycle—because they depend on humans to poke around the system—and will usually be one of the latest steps executed, but should still be part of the feedback cycle!-->
	
	对于自动化的步骤，我们分辨出哪个步骤耗费时间长，然后想办法改进。
	
	<!--For automated steps, we can also check which ones take longer and find a way to improve them. -->
	
	另外一个关键因素是能够提供高效，准确的反馈。如果管道中的一个job，负责很多事情，当失败时，团队很难确定具体哪里失败了并且又可能隐藏信息。保持比较小的步骤，清晰的错误信息，可以提高团队查找bug的效率，防止团队对管道技术失去信心－a.k.a. [just re-run the build - it should go green.](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/write-better-tests-5-steps)
	
	<!--Another key factor here is to also provide effective feedback. A pipeline job that does a lot of things makes it hard for the team to identify what failed and may hide information. Having small steps, with clear error messages, increases the team's effectiveness when debugging a failure and avoids losing confidence in the pipeline - a.k.a. just re-run the build - it should go green.
-->

3. 减少人工的介入

	<!--3. Requires Minimal Manual Interaction-->

	我们非常喜欢自动化，在交付软件的过程中，仍然需要人工的介入。但是我们可以将人工介入最小化，更高效。
	
	<!--As much as we like automation, there is still a need for human interaction in the process of delivering software. But we can work to make this interaction minimal and more effective.-->
	
	在任何的人工测试之前，最好能够保证，在一个与生产环境相似的环境中，所有的自动化步骤已经成功。这种方式不仅测试了应用，并且测试了配置。可以节省花费在解决环境问题的时间。
	
	<!--Before any manual testing, it's best to ensure that all automated stages have passed the build in an environment that is as similar to production as your project can afford. This way, not only will the application be tested, but also the configuration in which it will run. Doing that, you can save people's time by avoiding running into environment issues.-->
	
	大部分花费几天，几周甚至几个月进行人工测试的情况，往往是由于测试人员与开发团队没有或者仅有很少的合作。如果所有的部署都需要经过一个完整的质量管理部门，大量的团队时间就被消耗。
	
	<!--Most of the situations where manual testing takes a really long time—like days, weeks or even months—happen because there is little or no interaction at all between the people who run tests and the rest of the team who developed the product. Usually when all deploys need to go through a completely silo-ed QMO (Quality Management Office) first, a lot of time in the team's feedback cycle is consumed.-->
	
	这里的意思并不是说人工测试（manual tests）是二等公民，而是人们应该合作，使过程高效。参照 ['Amigos' 策略](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/are-you-truly-cross-functional-meet-amigos).
	
	<!--This doesn't mean that manual tests should be a second class citizen, it just means that people should collaborate to make it more effective—as suggested by the ['Amigos' strategy](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/are-you-truly-cross-functional-meet-amigos).
-->	
	![](/img/Delivery_Pipeline04_c53c72e41bf0715b8574ca79386e7a46.png)
	
	划分功能的团队，通常不清楚其他团队的工作，所有每个人尽力把自己的事情做好。因此，每个功能都会被完整测试，造成浪费，如 [the testing cupcake anti-pattern](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/introducing-software-testing-cupcake-anti-pattern) 所说。
	
	<!--Having functional teams usually leads to a scenario where no one knows about what the other team is doing, so everyone wants to make sure they are doing the best they can. Thus, every piece of functionality is tested through all levels, leading to wasted efforts as described in the testing cupcake anti-pattern.-->
	
	<!--To achieve minimal manual interaction in the pipeline, leverage the fact that everyone in the team is a human being (yes, that's true!) and just talk to each other.-->

4. 使用相同的过程和包

	<!--4. Uses the Same Process and Binaries-->
	
	不管之前团队做过多少测试，应用将要上线的时候，每个人还是会有些担心。我们如何提升对我们部署的自信呢？持续交付的方式就是保证从开始到生产环境，都使用同样的包执行所有的过程。
	
	<!--Whenever an application has to go live, no matter how much the team has tested it before, everybody gets (at least) a bit worried. How can we improve the confidence of what we are deploying? The CD (Continuous Delivery) answer is to make sure you exercise the same process with the same binaries all along the way to production.-->
	
	一个二进制包在这里表示要被部署到一台服务器的包。有可能是一个系统包，有特殊标签的源码，一个docker镜像等。不管是什么，一个好的管道会使用完全一样的包部署到不同的环境中，在预发布环境中也是使用同样的包加速生产或者简单的QA测试用作探索测试。
	
	<!--A binary in this context is the actual artifact that gets deployed in a server. This may be a system package, the actual source code in a specific tag, a docker image etc. Regardless of what it is, a good pipeline will use the exact same binaries to deploy in all environments, be it the super powerful Stage environment that is used to simulate production or the simple QA that is used for exploration tests.-->
	
	另外一个关键点是使用相同的过程部署包。如果有自动化脚本部署到QA环境，也应该使用他部署生产以及其他环境。如果你部署到生产是手动部署，有很大的概率会出现人为错误，简单的打字错误到忘记一个启动服务器前的关键步骤。
	
	<!--Another key part is to also use the same process to deploy the binaries. If you have automated scripts to deploy to the QA environment, you should use it to deploy to production - as well as any other environments. If the deploy to production is manual, there is a high chance of human error, ranging from a simple typo to forgetting an important step before turning the servers back up.-->
	
	任何环境间的不同都应该抽取到配置文件中作为自动化脚本的输入。这样你可以保证部署过程在生产环境也会生效，虽然配置的错误也时有发生。
	
	<!--Whatever varies from one environment to another should be extracted to configuration files that will serve as input to the automated deploy script. This way, you ensure that the process itself will work when it hits production, although configuration mistakes may still happen.-->
	
	自动化部署的过程，对你的团队是持续交付的好开端。如果你可以说服人们使用自动化脚本部署所有环境，CD的优势也会开始显示，引起大家的关注。但是请记住，自动化部署只是一个开始。
	
	<!--Automating the deployment process is a good way to kick-start Continuous Delivery in your team/organization. If you can convince people to use automated scripts to deploy all environments, the benefits of CD will start to show up and will get their attention. But keep in mind that automated deploys are just a starting point!
	-->
	
5. 能够在任何时候交付任何版本

	<!--5. Delivers (almost) Any Version Any Time-->
	
	持续交付的必杀技不是每天部署或者自动将每次提交上线生产，而是不需要经过软件研发团队的协助，使商业能够决定何时上线一个功能。由产品团队决定，是否每天，每小时或每月部署。

	<!--The nirvana of Continuous Delivery is not having daily deploys, or putting every commit in production automatically. It's actually enabling the business to decide when to go live with a feature, without having to ask for permission from the team developing the software. If it makes sense to deploy daily, hourly or monthly, it is up to the product team to decide.-->
	
	为了实现这个目标，管道必须（为产品团队）提供一种便捷的方式，可以在任何时间，发布任何版本。维持这样一个回滚策略有可能是个噩梦，所以需要团队根据项目，做出最佳的选择。或许更好的选择是，仅仅提供回滚到之前1，2个小版本的能力。
	
	<!--To achieve this, the pipeline must provide an easy way to deploy any version of the application, at any given time. Of course, maintaining a rollback strategy that allows this might be a nightmare, so again the team needs to understand the context of the project and make the best decision. Maybe it makes sense to keep a rollback just for one or two minor versions.-->
	
	这里的关键是，发布新的版本跟回滚到上一个版本一样简单，以防有一个严重的问题。理想情况下，你总是可以前滚和借助[功能切换](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)关闭一个崩溃功能。如果想了解更多功能切换，参照文章：[Enabling Trunk Based Development with Deployment Pipelines](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/enabling-trunk-based-development-deployment-pipelines)和[On DVCS, continuous integration, and feature branches](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/dvcs-continuous-integration-and-feature-branches)
	
	<!--The key point here is to make sure that you can roll forward (deploy a newer version) as easily as you can roll back (deploy an older version), just in case there is a major issue. Ideally, you could always roll forward and disable a broken feature with a feature toggle. I recommend these two articles if you want to know more about the usage of feature toggles: Enabling Trunk Based Development with Deployment Pipelines and On DVCS, continuous integration, and feature branches.-->
	
	回滚时，最大的困难是保证数据的完整（integrity）。理想情况下，团队应该避免破坏性变更，保持系统对之前版本的数据兼容性。某些场景，数据库备份有可能可行，但是回滚期间保存的数据会丢失。参照: [Refactoring Databases](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Databases-Evolutionary-paperback-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321774515)
	
	<!--One of the biggest problems when rolling back is to ensure data integrity. Ideally, the team should be able to avoid destructive changes and keep the system compatible with previous versions of the schema. In some scenarios, a database backup might be doable, but the data that is saved during the roll back time will be lost. The book Refactoring Databases, by Scott Ambler and Pramod Sadalage, might be a useful resource.
-->	

	将部署任何版本变得便捷不是一个简单的任务，但是不仅仅对产品团队有好处，对开发团队也有帮助。设想一下，你半夜接到电话，生产环境中一些功能崩溃。你登录，访问，但是找不到什么有用的信息。相比你将一整夜花在寻找这个bug，有可能影响你第二天。一个更优的选项是“好吧，暂时将系统回滚，明天深入调查”。
	
	<!--Making the deployment of any version easy can be a very hard task, but it has benefits not only to the product team, but also for the development team. Imagine something falls apart in production and you receive a call in the middle of the night. You log in and poke around, but can't find anything useful. While you could waste the rest of your night chasing bugs, and potentially ruin the next day as well, a much better option is to say "okay, let's just rollback for now and investigate deeper tomorrow".-->
	
	我希望本文能够帮助到你和你的团队，可以帮助提升你的管道。再次强调，这不是一个完成的广泛列表，一个优秀的管道需要包括。想要获取更深入的理解，可以参照文中列出的其它文章。
	
	<!--I hope this article is useful for you and your team and can help you improve your pipeline even more. Again, this is not an extensive list of what a good pipeline should look like. To have a more comprehensive perspective, don't forget to check the other articles linked here.-->
